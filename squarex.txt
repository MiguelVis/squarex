OVERVIEW
========

Squarex is a game for the Amstrad PCW.

Your goal is to complete lines (or rows) of squares, with the
pieces that fall from the top of the screen.
 
The completed lines will disappear.

Do you remember the name of a game that does something similar?

Er... humm... yes, you do, don't you?


TECHNICAL NOTES
===============

This game has been developed with MESCC, my own Small-C compiler
version, and the XPCW library for the Amstrad PCW.

Both are available in my website, and are released under the GPL
license (the source code is included).

You can read the source code of Squarex for more information.
